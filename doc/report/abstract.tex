We consider affine universal geometry in the case of a two dimensional vector space with an arbitrary quadratic form over a general field.
A series of theorems for lines and conics are presented, which extend previous results from Euclidean rational trigonometry and chromogeometry.
A numerical software library, \pygeom\!\!, is also presented.
This library uses the results derived here to allow calculations to be performed.
