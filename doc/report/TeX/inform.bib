		  programming language concept and reports our initial
		  investigations of its utility. The concept is to
		  identify persistence as an orthogonal property of
		  data, independent of data type and the way in which
		  data is manipulated. This is expressed by the
		  principle that all data objects, independent of
		  their data type, should have the dame rights to
		  persistence or transience. We expect to achieve
		  persistent independent programming, so that the same
		  code is applicable to data of any persistence. We
		  have designed a language PS-algol by using these
		  ideas and constructed a number of implementations.
		  The experience gained is reported here, as a step in
		  the task of achieving languages with proper
		  accomodation for persistent programming.",
